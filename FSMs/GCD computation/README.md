This folder contains codes and simulation results of a practical implementation of FSM, namely GCD computation. 
The two numbers taken for GCD computation are 78 and 143 (as may be verfied from TestBench code).
Finally, the simulation output shows value of A to be hexadecimal 000d (equal  to 13 in decimal, as may be expected).
